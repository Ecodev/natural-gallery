# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but keep in mind that the gallery will stay simple : too generalist or too specific features that could be done from your controllers won't be added.

## Found a bug ?

Report what you observe, what you expect to observe, and the context of usage. 

## Want a new feature ?

Consider a pull request, but create an issue before to expose your idea. Maybe the feature you would like to add is already on the pipeline or is intentionally not included for good reasons. 

# Licence

Developed by [ecodev](https://ecodev.ch) under MIT licence, the app is free of use, even for commercial usage. Even if it's not required a credit would be much appreciated.
